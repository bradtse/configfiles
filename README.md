configfiles
========

These are a few of my more important configuration files.

Directions: 

1. Add file you want to keep track of into configfiles root directory. I recommend not using any dot names so that
   the file is not hidden.
2. Enter entry into the configlists.txt file. Examples can be found in 
   configlists.txt.
3. Run setup.py. Use -h for options
