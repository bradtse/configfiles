configfiles
========

These are a few of my more important configuration files.

To use:
1. Add file into configfiles folder. I recommend not using any dot names so that
   the file is not hidden.
2. Enter entry into the configlists.txt file. Examples can be found in
   configlists.txt.
3. Run setup.py.
